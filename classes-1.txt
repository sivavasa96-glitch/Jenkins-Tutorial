Introduction for Jenkins:
=========================

what is jenkins:
=================
Jenkins is an open-source automation tool mainly used in DevOps to build, test, and deploy applications automatically.

What Jenkins does:
======================

1. Automatically pulls code from Git (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)

2. Builds the application (Maven, Gradle, npm, etc.)

3. Runs tests (unit, integration, automation)

4. Deploys the app to servers, Docker, Kubernetes, cloud, etc.

5. Sends build status (success/failure) notifications

Why Jenkins is used:
=====================

Supports CI/CD (Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment)

Detects bugs early

Saves time and reduces human errors

Huge plugin support (Git, Maven, Docker, Kubernetes, SonarQube)

Real-world example:
========================

Developer pushes code → Jenkins auto builds → tests → creates JAR/WAR → deploys → done 🚀

Lifecycle in Jenkins Pipeline stages::
======================================
Checkout → Build → Test → Analyze → Package → Deploy → Monitor

1.Code Commit
-------------

Developer writes code and pushes it to Git (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket).

2.Trigger Jenkins
-----------------

Jenkins job starts automatically (via webhook, SCM poll, or manual trigger).

3.Checkout Source Code
----------------------
Jenkins pulls the latest code from the repository.

4.Build
------------
Code is compiled and packaged (JAR/WAR/Docker image).

Tools: Maven, Gradle, npm, Docker.

5.Test
------------

Runs automated tests.

Unit tests, integration tests, UI tests.

6. Static Code Analysis (Optional)
-----------------------------------

Code quality and security checks.

Tools: SonarQube, Checkstyle.

7. Artifact Creation & Storage
-------------------------------
Build artifacts are created and stored.

Example: Nexus, Artifactory, Docker Registry.

8.Deploy
-------
Application is deployed to target environment.

Dev → QA → Staging → Production

Tools: Tomcat, Kubernetes, AWS, Azure.

9.Verification
---------------

Smoke tests / health checks run after deployment.

10.Notification & Feedback
------------------------
Jenkins sends build status to developers.

Email, Slack, Teams.
