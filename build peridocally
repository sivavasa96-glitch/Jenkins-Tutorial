6) Build Triggers:
===================

1) Build periodically (Cronjob) 
“This trigger runs the Jenkins job on a schedule, like every night or every 10 minutes, even if there are no code changes. It’s mainly used for regular builds, nightly builds, and health checks.”
Example use: nightly build at 1 AM.

2) Poll SCM

“In Poll SCM, Jenkins checks the Git repository at a fixed time interval. If Jenkins finds any new commit, then it triggers the build. If there’s no change, it won’t run.”
Key point: Jenkins is polling (pulling) Git again and again.

3) GitHub Webhook

“In webhook, GitHub directly notifies Jenkins whenever code is pushed or a pull request is created. So Jenkins starts the build immediately. It’s faster and more efficient than Poll SCM.”
Key point: GitHub pushes the event to Jenkins.

4) Trigger after another job

“This trigger starts a job automatically after another job completes. We use it to create a pipeline flow like: Build job → Test job → Deploy job.”
Key point: job chaining / job dependency.

✅ 7) Plugins (Jenkins):
==========≈==============

What are Jenkins plugins?

“Plugins are add-ons in Jenkins. Jenkins by default has limited features, but plugins help us integrate Jenkins with other tools like Git, Maven, Docker, Kubernetes, SonarQube, AWS, etc.”

Why plugins are used?

“We use plugins to extend Jenkins functionality. Without plugins, Jenkins cannot connect to external tools or perform advanced CI/CD tasks.”
